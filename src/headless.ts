/**
 * The real renderer, off screen, for tools.
 *
 * Not part of the game. It exists because the only honest picture of the city
 * is one the game's own frame loop drew, and the software rasteriser the
 * tools run under takes the canvas presentation path down within a second of
 * boot. So this builds the same Renderer against a texture instead of a
 * window, drives it by hand, and hands back pixels.
 *
 * Bundled separately and loaded into a blank page by tools/city-shot.mjs.
